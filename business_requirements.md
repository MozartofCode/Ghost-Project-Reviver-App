# Business Requirements: Project Phoenix (The Ghost Project Reviver)

## 1. Executive Summary
Project Phoenix is a marketplace for abandoned open-source software. It solves the "Dead Repo" problem by connecting original creators who no longer have time for their projects with ambitious developers looking to lead and maintain established codebases.

## 2. User Personas
### A. The "Retiring" Maintainer
- **Goal:** Wants their project to live on without personal involvement.
- **Pain Point:** Guilt over ignored issues and "repo rot."
- **Need:** A vetted, easy way to find a successor.

### B. The "Portfolio" Builder
- **Goal:** Wants to prove they can handle production-grade code.
- **Pain Point:** Building "To-Do" apps doesn't impress recruiters.
- **Need:** An existing project with a user base to manage and improve.

## 3. Key Feature Requirements
- **Repo Discovery:** Searchable database of repositories filtered by "Abandonment Score."
- **Adoption Pitch:** A workflow where applicants submit a "Why me?" pitch to the owner.
- **Succession Tracking:** A public log of successful handovers to build platform trust.
- **Verification:** Integration with GitHub OAuth to ensure users actually own the repos they list.

## 4. Monetization (Future)
- Featured "Hot Repos" for developers looking for high-visibility projects.
- "Project Rescue" badges for LinkedIn profiles.
